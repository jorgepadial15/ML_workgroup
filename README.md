# ML_workgroup

This rep is created by a Vanderbilt-based group of students making first steps in Machine Learning. Check out the SFreataurants branch to see progress in our pet project.

We meet every other Friday at 1 pm (CST) in the Stevenson Library (in person) or via Zoom. 

We follow the classic [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

Feel free to contact us if you want to join!

Some good resorces:

- There is a good video playlist for python for data science: ["Python for Data Science Complete Video Course"](https://newsonline.library.vanderbilt.edu/2020/01/database-spotlight-oreilly-for-higher-education/).

- Using MATLAB for ML: ["Getting Started with MATLAB Machine Learning"](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/videos/getting-started-with/9781788999847?autoplay=false)
