This project is for playing with [San-Francisco Restaurant Scores data](https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i?row_index=0)

## Tentative goal
  - Predict the inspection score based on the location of the restaurant
  - Predict the dates and routes for inspection (?) to get the most effective results (to observe most of the voilations)

## Setting environment
- To improve reproducibility of the project I've created environment.yml file so now everyone can create the same conda environment (details in the resources.md)
