## Preparation

- Simple and amazing guide for creating and understanding [Virtual Environments](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-conda-environments-bc6180fc533)
- Information on separate packages:
	- [Installation guide for scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
	- [Installation guide for great-expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/0.9.3/getting_started.html)

## Understanding
- [ML project workflow](https://towardsdatascience.com/workflow-of-a-machine-learning-project-ec1dba419b94)
- Great expectations
	It is a package for python that helps you to (1) get a sense what data you will be working with and (2) run a bunch of tests (expectation vs reality) on the content of the incoming data so you know for sure how the data look.
	Usage examples (It is Ok to skip them - not very suitable for beginners):
